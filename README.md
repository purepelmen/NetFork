# NetFork
Custom networking solution for Unity.
Maybe this will be used in Facility Manager, if will be better than Mirror (for me ðŸ™‚).

## About NetFork
1. It works only on one transport: UDP (ENet-CSharp)
2. It uses only low-level things (for now). Has a message handler and doesn't has any things like NetworkBehaviour, NetworkIdentity, Command/ClientRpc.
3. May has some bugs.
4. May cause lags (hope not).
5. Not regularly updated.
